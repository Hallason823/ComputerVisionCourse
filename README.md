# Computer Vision – CIn UFPE (Jan 2024 – Oct 2024)

This repository contains projects, experiments, and AI applications developed during the **Computer Vision** course at the **Centro de Informática (CIn)**, **Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)**. The course was held from **January to October 2024**, with a strong focus on **Artificial Intelligence**, **image processing**, and **performance on mobile and heterogeneous systems**.

---

## Course Focus

The course emphasized the following areas:

- **Image Processing & Computer Vision**
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** techniques applied to visual data
- **Programming with Halide**, a language designed for high-performance image processing
- **Performance analysis** of AI systems, especially on mobile and embedded platforms
- **Evaluation of image quality** and its role in vision-based systems
- Applied research and development in collaboration with **lux.ai**

---

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python (OpenCV, NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow)**
- **Halide Language** – for custom image pipelines
- **ONNX Runtime** and **TensorRT** – for deploying optimized AI models
- **Mobile AI frameworks** (e.g., MediaPipe, Core ML, TFLite)
- **CUDA and heterogeneous computing environments**
- **Image quality metrics**: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and perceptual loss
